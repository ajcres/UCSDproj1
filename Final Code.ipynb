    "This program takes a twitter user's ID and lists their most commonly used hashtage, mentinons, and words\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To do this the twitter library from ipython is used along with a twitter developer account to get a list of the last 200 posts from a single user.\n",
    "2. If the user inputted is not able to be found or there is not enough alavible data than an appropriate error will be printed\n",
    "3. For each post in the list each word from the string is extraced and is revoved or modified based on a number of factors including: being an artifact form twitter, not using ascii characters, being a common english word, being a link, and having grammer marks\n",
    "4. The remaining word strings are then catagorized by their type (word, hashtag or mention) and are added to an array\n",
    "5. After each post is processed in this way, the lists of word types are put into a function that creates a double (2d) array with the strings as the first value and the number of appearances as the second value.\n",
    "6. This double array is then sorted by the number of appearances and the top values are printed, but the number of values printed depends on a multiplier for that type (with words printing the lowest fraction and hashtags printing the highest) and it will not print more than 20 of each type to only show the data which is most relevant\n",
    "7. If there is no data to print for a type after steps 1-5, than an message will be printed instead"
